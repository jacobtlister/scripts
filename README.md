# what is this repository?

I use Linux Mint as my daily driver, so over time I have created some scripts, and I store them in this repository (mostly so I can easily access them across devices).<br><br>

I have chosen to make these scripts either because I cannot find a package that does exactly what I want, or I wanted to just make something for fun.<br><br>

I am also using this as an opportunity to learn markdown as I am setting up and updating this README.<br><br>

# what do these scripts do?

Each script's function will be pretty self - explanatory by the filename, but there will also be a description of the script, required packages (if any), and any other additional notes in the file itself. Scripts are also organized into different directories based on their shared functionality. For instance, the scripts contained in the `converters` directory will convert files from one type to another (ie image to pdf).<br><br>

# what do I use to script?

I use GNU bash 5.1.16 (current verion). I use VS Code as my text editor.<br><br>

# explanation of repository contents

`template.sh` is the template script I use for all of my scripts.<br><br>

`resources.md` links to different resources I have used (and for what reason), which are usually links to stack overflow answers or tutorials on programming - oriented websites.<br><br>

`converters` contains scripts that convert files of one type to another.<br><br>

# scripts

I use Linux Mint as my daily driver, so to automate some tasks, I have created these scripts.<br><br>

Each script's function will be pretty self - explanatory by the filename, but there will also be a description of the script, required packages (if any), and any other additional notes in the file itself.<br><br>

`resources.md` contains different resources I have consulted when making my scripts, which are usually links to stack overflow answers.<br><br>

`converters` contains scripts that convert files of one type to another.<br><br>

## shell check package for vs code (the goat)

shell check is a vs code extension and linux package that checks your shell scripts for errors and suggest<br>
fixes for broken or risky code. overall, this utility is incredibly helpful when making scripts<br><br>
you can install the package from your package manager or go to the github<br>
https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck<br><br>
the vs code extension goes by the same name as the package (the extension requires the package)<br>

## solid all - in - one shell scripting guide

as i have been working on this repository i have been looking for good resources to learn shell scripting. over<br>
time i have come across lots of stack exchange / overflow topics that cover one - off or niche topics, but this guide<br>
linked below is the best general guide / learning tool i have found for shell scripting. it starts from nothing and<br>
builds on the topics over time. it also provide good practice problems to go along with each topic introduced and<br>
covered, so it would be an especially good resource for beginners. it also links to other useful resources which is nice.<br><br>

resources linked below and made my customized print function.<br><br>
